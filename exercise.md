# 1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.

the terminal is extremely powerful and it is the gateway to communicating and interacting with programs, typically used because there is no GUI. it is a command line interface. in order to get to this point not only did i have to use the resources provided but i needed to update the git package that is installed to this macbook machine, and to do that i needed to update my brew which is a package manager, and then finally could i update my git via brew. the command in the video she demonstrated was not working for me i believe it was the la command after navigating to a folder, with this command it was supposed to show me the hidden .git file but it did not so what i had to do was ls -a command.
