# 1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.

The terminal is extremely powerful, and it is the gateway to communicating and interacting with programs, typically used because there is no GUI. It is a command line interface. You can do many things from within the terminal, even with no external programs, some of these things being navigating folders and files, creating new folders and files, deleting files, listing out directories, and much more.
