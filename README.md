# 1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.

The terminal is extremely powerful and the gateway to communicating and interacting with the computer and programs, typically used because there is no GUI. It is a command line interface. You can do many things from within the terminal, even with no external programs, some of these things being navigating folders and files, creating new folders and files, deleting files, listing out directories, and much more. Executing actions with administrator privileges is possible by putting sudo before the command you want to use.

# 2. What is the major difference between Git and GitHub?

The major difference is that Git is a version control system, and GitHub is a file-hosting website that hosts Gits. Without Git, there would be no GitHub. It is the same relationship as JavaScript has to vscode. One is a system/language, and the other is a tool that has alternatives, but its purpose is to be more user-friendly and smoother.

# 3. What are the steps to fork a GitHub repository?

To fork a repo, you must go to where it is located on GitHub, once you are on the page of the repo you want to, you will click the green fork button, and there you go you will rename it if you wish and add a description and done. You have successfully added a copy of the repo to your own GitHub. To make use of this fork we created, we will go to vscode (or whatever coding-focused text editor you wish), and you will open your terminal and then proceed to clone it as you would if you had created the project.
